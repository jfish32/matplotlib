# matplotlib

In this assignment we created multiple different plots using primarily matplotlib.  We had to do some data manipulation to analyze how the Capoumulin drug treatment performed.

The code to execute is found in the Pymaceuticals folder, and is title Complete_notebook.ipymb.

I looked back on class activities to help with the different types of plots.
